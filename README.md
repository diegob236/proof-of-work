# Proof of Work: Hyperledger Resume Verification
Authors: Diego Batres & Nicholas Deckhut

The goal of this project is to build a blockchain web application to verify history of employment for our users. Our project aims to reduce the overhead of verifying if an applicantâ€™s qualifications are authentic by implementing a QR code scanner to pull up their work history. The idea of using a blockchain is to have a secure, permanent record of work experience verified by the employers themselves. This project aims to help users by expediting the job application process and help employers and managers by reducing the time they spend verifying employees.
